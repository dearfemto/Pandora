            <div class="image-container"></div>
            <div><strong style="color: crimson;">1. Knowing your purpose</strong>
            <p>Everyone has a purpose in life, some people don't, and some people don't even know what that purpose is. There is three type of people:</p>
                <ol><li>Those who believe in God know that the purpose of life is to worship God.</li>
                    <li>Those who believe in God but do not fulfill their obligations also know that the purpose of life is to worship God.</li>
                    <li>Those who do not have faith in God do not believe in the purpose of life.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>These three types of people will always exist: from before you are born, while you are alive, and after you die. We live to worship God, but don't think the road will always be smooth when you cross it, because there will always be those who block your path. Everyone has their own way, their own dreams, and their own goals while on this earth. But remember, when you think about what your dreams are for the future, always consider what God likes and stay away from things that God doesn't like or forbids. Then you will get what you deserve when you die.</p>
            </div>
            <div><strong style="color: crimson;">2. Patient is priority</strong>
                <p>Open your eyes wide, embrace clarity, and maintain your calm. This is the pathway to the success you seek. When serenity replaces panic, everything will fall into place. Your mind will find peace, and your body will thrive in calmness.</p>
            </div>
            <div><strong style="color: crimson;">3. Always ask "WHY"</strong>
                <p>Why is this happening? Why am I here? Why am i doing this? Always seek the answers to these questions, for in your relentless pursuit, you will uncover the clues that guide you toward your true desires.</p></div>
            <div><strong style="color: crimson;">4. You born to win</strong>
                <p>The world ain't a sunshine and rainbows it's a very mean and nasty place, you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, that's how winning is done. People say it's okay if you're stupid, it's okay if you're poor, it's okay if you're lazy, it's okay if you're timid, it's okay if you are blabla. The answer is NO, you should be the best, you should be smart, you should be a man, you should be number one, you should be rich, you should have whatever you want, you have to want everything.</p></div>
                <p>Wherever you are, always be the best in your field, no one can beat you except when you stop stepping. Be a Winner.</p>
                <p>How could you not win if you really want it that bad.</p>
            <div><strong style="color: crimson;">5. Failure isn't real</strong>
                <p>Mailure is a natural thing that happens and is experienced by everyone. Though I may not know you personally, I firmly believe that in my perspective, failure is not an option. True failure only exists for those who give up. I don't fail, I learn, analyze, evaluate, and improve. Thus, failure is not real; it is an illusion. Who would you become, who would you be. You have the power to shape your destiny; the only one holding you back from achieving success is yourself.</p></div>
            <div><strong style="color: crimson;">6. Conviction</strong>
                <p>Most people die not because of external challenges, but due to a loss of faith and confidence in their pursuits. If you genuinely believe in a something, then stride forward with unwavering conviction and trust in your endeavors. Embrace your journey with conviction, knowing that belief in yourself is the cornerstone of success.</p></div>
